                        >Thank you for having an interest in my profile. I am a
                        candidate with a background in mathematical model
                        development and risk management, as well as some
                        experience in pre- and post-sales of vendor systems. I
                        am an avid fan of coding and use a lot of programming at
                        my various jobs, regardless of whatever its nature may
                        be - I tend to find some way to integrate small coding
                        projects into my day-to-day.</span

                        teams providing insightful product knowledge and helping
                        buy-side clients to streamline their processes and
                        workflows, as well as understand the risk metrics
                        produced by the system and computation processes. This
                        role allowed me some exposure in communicating with
                        C-level executives and risk practitioners.

                        roles within banks and the energy company, I accumulated
                        experience in quantitative model development in Python,
                        VBA and C pertaining to financial derivatives, option
                        pricing, risk metrics, optimization routines in the
                        scopes of market risk, and operational (non-financial)
                        risk. I was also exposed to some leadership experience,
                        having assumed the team head role in one of the bank
                        positions. During this time, I have had dealings with
                        banking supervisory, external consultants and vendors.
                        Working with financial institutions also granted me some
                        familiarity with concepts behind risk and capital
                        adequacy as well as Basel compliance.

                        risk engines.
